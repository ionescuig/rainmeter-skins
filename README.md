# Rainmeter Skins
### desktop personalization with rainmeter

[Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/) allows you to display customizable skins on your desktop, from hardware usage meters to fully functional audio visualizers.  
You are only limited by your imagination and creativity.  
Rainmeter is open source software distributed free of charge under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 license.

After installing rainmeter, double-click on the skin *Hexa (modified)_1.0.rmskin*.  
Location of the new folder: C:\Users\\*User*\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\.

Full documentation about how to personalize your skin: [official site](https://docs.rainmeter.net/).  
Other skins: [deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/popular-all-time/?section=&global=1&q=rainmeter).  
Best way for me to edit the skins is using [Atom](https://atom.io/), with *language-rainmeter* package.
